Prophecy Watchers Magazine Database

## Welcome to the Prophecy Watchers Magazine Database (pwm-db)
- The purpose of this project is to create a database of all the Prophecy Watchers Magazine articles to allow searching by author(s)/title.  This database does not include the article itself.
- These text files should be able to run on Macintosh, Linux, or Windows computers, though they were developed on Windows laptop.

### History of the Prophecy Watchers Magazine Database (pwm-db) project.
- First, I am not affiliated with Prophecy Watchers or the Prophecy Watchers Magazine, though I did received permission to create the Prophecy Watchers Magazine Database.
- I have been blessed that I found Prophecy Watchers a few months prior to the release of the Premier Issue of the Prophecy Watchers Magazine.  I subscribed and now I have a lifetime subscription to the Prophecy Watchers Magazine.  So, I am blessed having all paper issues of the Prophecy Watchers Magazine.
- I knew the Prophecy Watchers Magazine needed an index, when I was searching for Dr. Ken Johnson's article about the Enoch's seven year calendar.  I searched from the first issue until I found it.
- And, I wanted to share the database so that others may find it useful.
- And, try to make it cross-platform.

### Searching by author
* Articles/titles written by the same author, but show different names/titles within the issue, will have a name written in parenthesis.  The name within the parenthesis will commonly have the shortest name that I have found (i.e. **Ken Johnson**).  This will allow one search for all titles by an author using the name within the parenthesis.
* The best method to search for an author is by last name only first; no first name, nickname, or titles.
